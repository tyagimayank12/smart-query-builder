INPUT:
- Industry/Business Type: "{industry}"
- Geographic Region: "{region}"
- Number of queries needed: {top_k}

YOUR TASK:
Generate {top_k} highly diverse and intelligent Google search queries to find contacts in this industry.

CRITICAL RULES FOR UNDERSTANDING THE INDUSTRY:

1. **Semantic Intelligence** (MOST IMPORTANT):
   - Understand what "{industry}" actually means
   - If it's a long phrase like "real estate brokerage firms", understand the core business (real estate companies)
   - If it's "Insurance broker agents and agencies", understand it means BOTH professionals AND companies
   - If it's generic like "Insurance", expand to specific types (health insurance, auto insurance, life insurance)
   - DO NOT just append words like "specialist", "consultant", "provider" to the input
   - CREATE variations based on understanding, not templates

2. **Generate Semantic Variations**:
   - Synonyms: Different ways to describe the same business
   - Related roles: Job titles in this industry  
   - Company types: Different business structures in this industry
   - Specializations: Specific niches within the industry
   - Service variations: Different services offered

3. **Query Patterns - B2C Business Website Searches ONLY**:
   
   You are searching for ACTUAL BUSINESS WEBSITES (B2C), NOT individual professionals or LinkedIn profiles.
   
   Pattern A - .com Domain Search with Email (50% of queries):
   site:.com "Business Type" "Location" "@email.com"
   Examples:
   - site:.com "Insurance Agency" "Manhattan" "@gmail.com"
   - site:.com "Real Estate Brokerage" "Brooklyn" "@yahoo.com"
   - site:.com "Coffee Shop" "Portland" "@outlook.com"
   
   Pattern B - Multiple TLD Search with Contact (30% of queries):
   site:.org OR site:.net "Business Type" "Location" contact OR email
   Examples:
   - site:.org "Insurance Broker" "New York" contact
   - site:.net "Real Estate Agency" "Queens" email
   - site:.com "Property Management" "Manhattan" contact
   
   Pattern C - Open Web Business Search (20% of queries):
   "Business Type" "Location" "@email.com" -linkedin -indeed -jobs -careers
   Examples:
   - "Insurance Agency" "New York" "@gmail.com" -linkedin -jobs
   - "Real Estate Brokerage" "Chicago" "@yahoo.com" -indeed -careers
   - "Coffee Roastery" "Portland" "@outlook.com" -linkedin

4. **Geographic Intelligence**:
   - If "{region}" is a CITY (like "New York", "Chicago", "Los Angeles"):
     * Include main city name
     * Include major neighborhoods/boroughs
     * Include metro area variations
   - If "{region}" is a STATE (like "California", "Texas"):
     * Include major cities in that state
     * Include state name and abbreviation
   - If "{region}" is SMALL/UNKNOWN:
     * Use the exact region name provided
     * Don't make up locations

5. **Email Domain Rotation** (for queries that need email):
   - Rotate through: @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, @outlook.com, @hotmail.com
   - Occasionally use: @aol.com, @live.com, @icloud.com, @protonmail.com
   - Don't repeat same email domain consecutively

6. **Business Types to Focus On** (B2C ONLY):
   - Local businesses: Coffee shops, restaurants, retail stores
   - Service companies: Insurance agencies, real estate brokerages, law firms
   - Professional firms: Accounting firms, consulting companies, marketing agencies
   - Healthcare providers: Medical clinics, dental offices, urgent care centers
   - Home services: Plumbing companies, HVAC contractors, cleaning services
   
   Focus on finding their WEBSITES (.com, .org, .net domains), NOT their LinkedIn profiles or employees.

7. **CRITICAL - B2C ONLY (Avoid B2B Platforms)**:
   ❌ NEVER use: site:linkedin.com
   ❌ NEVER use: site:zoominfo.com
   ❌ NEVER use: site:apollo.io
   ❌ NEVER use: site:rocketreach.com
   ❌ NEVER use: site:crunchbase.com
   
   ✅ ONLY use: site:.com, site:.org, site:.net, OR open web searches
   ✅ ALWAYS exclude: -linkedin -indeed -jobs -careers -hiring
   
   We're finding BUSINESS WEBSITES, not individual people or business directories.

8. **Other Mistakes to AVOID**:
   ❌ Don't append generic words: "Insurance Brokers specialist" 
   ❌ Don't use unsupported operators: intitle:, inurl:, -site:
   ❌ Don't repeat similar queries (change location AND title AND email)
   ❌ Don't search for just email domains without context
   ❌ Don't use broken syntax like site:.com without meaningful terms

9. **Proper Query Syntax**:
   ✅ All phrases must be in quotes: "Insurance Broker" not Insurance Broker
   ✅ Email patterns in quotes: "@gmail.com" not @gmail.com
   ✅ Site operator format: site:linkedin.com OR site:.com
   ✅ Exclusions: -jobs -careers -hiring (when needed)
   ✅ Multiple terms: Use OR for alternatives: contact OR email

EXAMPLES TO LEARN FROM:

Example 1 - Input: "Insurance Brokers", Region: "New York"
B2C Focus: Find insurance agency/brokerage WEBSITES, not individual professionals
Good queries:
✅ site:.com "Insurance Agency" "Manhattan" "@gmail.com"
✅ site:.com "Insurance Brokerage" "Brooklyn" "@yahoo.com"
✅ site:.org "Independent Insurance Agent" "Queens" contact
✅ "Insurance Services" "New York" "@outlook.com" -linkedin -jobs
✅ site:.net "Insurance Broker" "Bronx" email
✅ site:.com "Commercial Insurance Agency" "Staten Island" "@hotmail.com"
✅ "Property & Casualty Insurance" "NYC" "@gmail.com" -indeed -careers
✅ site:.org "Insurance Company" "Manhattan" contact
✅ site:.com "Employee Benefits Insurance" "Greater New York" "@yahoo.com"
✅ "Risk Management Insurance" "New York" "@outlook.com" -linkedin

Bad queries (DON'T DO THIS):
❌ site:linkedin.com "Insurance Broker" "New York" "@gmail.com"
❌ site:zoominfo.com "Insurance Agency" "Manhattan"
❌ site:apollo.io "Insurance Broker" "NYC"
❌ intitle:"Insurance" "New York"
❌ "4" "Brooklyn" "@gmail.com"
❌ site:.com "company_page" "Insurance"

Example 2 - Input: "real estate brokerage firms", Region: "Chicago"
B2C Focus: Find real estate company WEBSITES
Good understanding: This means real estate company websites, not LinkedIn profiles
✅ site:.com "Real Estate Agency" "Chicago" "@gmail.com"
✅ site:.org "Real Estate Brokerage" "Loop" contact
✅ "Commercial Real Estate Firm" "Chicago" "@yahoo.com" -linkedin -jobs
✅ site:.net "Property Management Company" "Lincoln Park" email
✅ site:.com "Residential Real Estate" "Wicker Park" "@outlook.com"
✅ "Real Estate Services" "Chicago" "@gmail.com" -indeed -careers
✅ site:.org "Realty Company" "Downtown Chicago" contact
✅ site:.com "Real Estate Firm" "Chicagoland" "@hotmail.com"
✅ "Property Sales Company" "Illinois" "@yahoo.com" -linkedin
✅ site:.net "Real Estate Investment Firm" "Chicago" email

Example 3 - Input: "Coffee Shops", Region: "Portland"
B2C Focus: Find actual coffee shop business websites
✅ site:.com "Coffee Shop" "Portland" "@gmail.com"
✅ site:.com "Coffee House" "Downtown Portland" contact
✅ "Specialty Coffee Roaster" "Portland" "@yahoo.com" -linkedin -jobs
✅ site:.org "Cafe" "Pearl District" email
✅ "Independent Coffee Shop" "Portland OR" "@outlook.com" -indeed
✅ site:.net "Artisan Coffee" "Portland" contact
✅ site:.com "Coffee Roastery" "Alberta Arts" "@gmail.com"
✅ "Local Coffee Business" "Portland Metro" "@hotmail.com" -careers -linkedin
✅ site:.com "Espresso Bar" "Portland" email
✅ "Coffee Shop" "Oregon" "@yahoo.com" -jobs -indeed
